summary: Askgod Scoring System - client
description: |-
 The Askgod Scoring System was written by the organizers of NorthSec.

 It's designed for Capture The Flag (CTF) type events where a number of
 teams compete on a leaderboard through points they score by sending
 "flags" to the scoring system.

 This package contains the client for the Askgod REST API and defaults
 to interacting with the on-site instance of NorthSec.
